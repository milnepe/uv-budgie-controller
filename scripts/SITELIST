The UV Budgie uses the Met Office Datapoint Service which is an open API for weather data in the UK.

Full details can be found at:

To connect to your local weather station you need to register with the Met Office API and obtain a private key to access the API. You also need the ID of your local weather station which you can find using the supplied Python 3 scripts:

1. Clone the repo and change to the script subdirectory:

cd uv-budgie-controller/scripts

2. List the Met Office Unitary Authority Areas:

python3 areas.py '<your-api-key>'

...
Greater London
Greater Manchester
Guernsey
Gwynedd
Halton
...

3. List the weather stations in a particular Area:

python3 areas.py '<your-api-key>' 'Greater London'

...
354071 Walthamstow
351297 Ealing
354361 Wimbledon
353202 Richmond (Greater London)
351763 Harringay
351996 Ilford
354365 Qpr F.C.
...

4. Edit the file named "arduino_secrets.h" in the UVBudgieController directory substituting your own information:

#define SECRET_SSID "<your-ssid>"
#define SECRET_PASS "<your-wifi-password>"
#define API_KEY "<your-api-key>"
#define STATION_ID "<your-weather-station-id>"

5. Flash the Arduino
